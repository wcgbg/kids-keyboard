# A keyboard software made for my kid
It runs on a raspbarry PI with a speaker and a [a wireless numeric keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XD3387V/) for my kid. I redefine the keys and put lables on the key caps. When my kid presses a key, the speaker speaks some words or plays some music.
